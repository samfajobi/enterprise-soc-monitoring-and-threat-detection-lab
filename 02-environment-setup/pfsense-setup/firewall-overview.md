# 🔥 Firewall Overview

## 📌 Introduction

A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors, filters, and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on defined security rules.

It acts as a security boundary between trusted and untrusted networks and is one of the most critical security controls in modern enterprise environments.

## 🎯 Purpose of a Firewall

A firewall exists to:

* Enforce trust boundaries
* Control network access
* Reduce attack surface
* Prevent unauthorized access
* Provide visibility into traffic flows
* Log and monitor suspicious activity

At its core, a firewall answers:

Who can talk to who?  
On which port?  
Using which protocol?  
Under what conditions?

## 🌍 Understanding Network Zones

Firewalls operate between security zones. A zone represents a group of systems with similar trust levels.

### Common Enterprise Zones

## WAN (Untrusted Network)
* The Internet
* External partner networks
* Third-party connections

This zone is considered hostile and untrusted.
