# Brief overview of Atomic Red Team

## What Is Atomic Red Team?

Red Canary created Atomic Red Team.

Atomic Red Team is:

> A library of small, controlled attack simulations mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

Instead of running full-blown penetration tests, it lets you safely simulate specific attacker techniques on a system.

Think of it as:

🧪 “Unit testing” for your security controls.


# Why It Exists

Many organizations deploy:

 - SIEM

 - EDR

 - Firewall

 - IDS

 - Logging agents

But they don’t verify:

❓ Are detections actually working?
❓ Will alerts trigger for real attack behavior?
❓ Are logs being collected properly?

Atomic Red Team answers those questions.
