# Enterprise SOC Monitoring Project

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world **Enterprise Security Operations Center (SOC)** environment focused on centralized logging, threat detection, alerting, and incident response.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **SOC analyst skills** such as:
- Log collection and correlation
- Detection engineering
- Incident investigation
- Security monitoring across identity, endpoint, and network layers
- Documentation and operational thinking

The environment mirrors how a small-to-medium enterprise SOC operates using industry-relevant tools and workflows.

---

## Objectives
- Build an enterprise-style SOC monitoring environment
- Collect and analyze logs from multiple security data sources
- Create meaningful detections for common attack techniques
- Simulate SOC alert → investigation → response workflows
- Document detections, incidents, and lessons learned

---

## SOC Architecture

The lab environment consists of the following components:

- **Active Directory Domain Controller**
  - Centralized identity management
  - Authentication and authorization logging

- **Windows 10 Endpoint**
  - User workstation
  - Endpoint activity monitoring
