### What a Modem Is

Modem = MOdulator + DEModulator

A modem’s job is to translate signals between:

   * Your Internet Service Provider (ISP)

   * Your local network

Your ISP sends internet data using signals that your home devices cannot understand directly (fiber light signals, cable signals, DSL signals).
The modem converts those signals into digital data your router and devices can use.

### What a Modem Does

   * Connects directly to your ISP

   * Converts ISP signals → usable internet data

   * Assigns a public IP address (from your ISP)

   * Usually connects to a router via Ethernet cable

### What a Modem Does NOT Do

   * ❌ Does not create Wi-Fi
   * ❌ Does not manage multiple devices
   * ❌ Does not secure your network
